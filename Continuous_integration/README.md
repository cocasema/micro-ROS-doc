# Overview

Continuous Integration is good practice that consists of continuously integrating changes made to the project and testing them accordingly some configurable parameters.
Each new feature integration is verified by an automated build and test mechanisms in order to detect integration errors as quickly as possible and avoid uploading errors in the code.
Thanks to this practice, integration problems may be reduced and allows the team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.

## Main benefits of using Continuous integration

Using the CI is beneficial for many reasons.

* Reduced integration risk.

* Higher code quality.

* The code in version control works.

* Less time deploying.

## Good develop practices

* Don’t commit broken code.

* Write unit tests for each feature.

* Commit code frequently.

* Fix broken builds immediately.

* All tests must pass.
