# Architecture

For Micro-ROS, the type support used is `rosidl_typesupport_microxrcedds_c` for C language.
This ROS2 package generates Micro XRCE-DDS and Micro-CDR specific code to handle all the message types.

In Micro-ROS case, Micro XRCE-DDS type support generates four functions:

- cdr_serialize
- cdr_deserialise
- get_serialized_size
- max_serialized_size

Those four functions are equivalent to the ones generated by Micro XRCE-DDS Gen tool from Micro XRCE-DDS implementation.
In Micro-ROS, `rosidl_typesupport_microxrcedds_c` generates code straight from .msg files without using intermediate IDLs nor Micro XRCE-DDS Gen.
This generation uses a group of EmPy templates you can find in the `rosidl_typesupport_microxrcedds_c`  package.
